✅ How to Fix and Improve Your Project for the Final Submission

Excellent question, Erick 👏 — and the best part is that your professor already gave you the exact roadmap of what needs to be fixed so your project can be 100% ready for the final submission.

Here’s a step-by-step summary explaining what to fix, why, and how to do it correctly 👇

✅ 1. Category Encoding (DO NOT use .cat.codes)

❌ Problem:
You used .astype('category').cat.codes for columns like gender, parent_education, internet_access, lunch_type, and extra_activities.
This creates a false numerical order (for example, PhD > Master’s > High School) that doesn’t exist and confuses the model.

✅ Solution:
Use OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore') inside a ColumnTransformer.

Example:

from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

categorical_features = ['gender', 'parent_education', 'internet_access', 'lunch_type', 'extra_activities']

preprocess = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), categorical_features)
    ],
    remainder='passthrough'
)


This creates binary columns (0/1) without imposing any order among categories.

✅ 2. Avoid Data Leakage

❌ Problem:
You scaled and encoded data before splitting it with train_test_split.
This means the model “saw” part of the test data during training, artificially improving its accuracy.

✅ Solution:
Split the data first, and then fit your transformers inside a pipeline using only X_train.
The pipeline will automatically apply the same transformations to X_test without learning from it.

Example:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

numeric_features = ['math_score', 'reading_score', 'writing_score', 'attendance_rate', 'study_hours']
categorical_features = ['gender', 'parent_education', 'internet_access', 'lunch_type', 'extra_activities']

numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler())])
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))])

preprocess = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
    ])

model = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocess', preprocess),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))
])


This ensures the pipeline is trained only with the training set, and applies the same transformations to the test set safely.

✅ 3. Standardize Numeric Features

❌ Problem:
Models like Logistic Regression and SVM perform poorly if numeric variables are not on the same scale.

✅ Solution:
Use StandardScaler() inside the pipeline (already shown in the example above).

✅ 4. Create New Features (Feature Engineering)

Your dataset has a lot of potential, but you’re currently using the columns as they are.
You can create new derived variables that provide more context to the model.

Examples:

df['total_score'] = df['math_score'] + df['reading_score'] + df['writing_score']
df['avg_academic'] = df['total_score'] / 3
df['stem_bias'] = df['math_score'] - (df['reading_score'] + df['writing_score']) / 2
df['engagement'] = df['attendance_rate'] * df['study_hours']


These new features help the model detect clearer patterns and relationships.

👉 Important: create these new columns before splitting the data to make sure they remain available during preprocessing.

✅ 5. Handle New/Unknown Categories Robustly

This is automatically fixed by using:

OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')


It prevents errors if new, unseen category levels appear in future datasets.

✅ 6. You Don’t Need to Re-run the Model Now

Your professor said:

“You do not have to run the model — that will be part of the finals.
Do not resubmit cleaned code again, as the grade is final.”

👉 This means you should not upload another version now.
Just save these improvements and apply them all together for your final project submission.

✅ 7. Optional — Improve Visualizations

To make your final project stronger, you can include:

Boxplots or histograms showing score distributions.

Correlation heatmap with your new features.

Bar chart showing feature importance (if you use Random Forest).

🔥 In summary, your final version should include:
Stage	What to Include
Preprocessing	OneHotEncoder + StandardScaler inside a ColumnTransformer
Pipeline	Fit and transform data without leakage
Feature Engineering	New variables: total_score, avg_academic, stem_bias, engagement
Models	Logistic Regression and Random Forest
Evaluation	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
Visualizations	Boxplots, Heatmap, Model Comparison Graphs

Would you like me to prepare the final corrected Colab code in English, including all these fixes, comments, and clean structure — so you can just run it during your finals and attach the final cleaned dataset?
