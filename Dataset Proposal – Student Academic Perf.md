Dataset Proposal – Student Academic Performance Prediction

Author: Erick Banegas
Date: October 2025
Dataset Source: Kaggle – Student Academic Performance Dataset

1. Overview

This dataset contains detailed academic and demographic information from 1,000 students, including their grades in math, reading, and writing, attendance rate, study hours, parental education level, internet access, and extracurricular activities. The dataset also includes a final_result column that indicates whether the student passed or failed.

2. Objective

The main goal of this project is to predict student academic performance, specifically whether a student will pass or fail, based on academic and socio-educational features.

3. Proposed Tasks

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to identify trends, missing values, and correlations between features and the final result.

Feature Selection: Determine which factors (such as attendance rate, study hours, or parental education) have the greatest impact on student outcomes.

Model Development: Build and train classification models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Decision Tree.

Evaluation: Measure model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Create graphs that show relationships between variables and the predicted results.

4. Expected Outcome

The project aims to help identify students who are at risk of failing before the end of the semester. This can assist schools and teachers in taking early interventions to improve academic performance and student support strategies.
