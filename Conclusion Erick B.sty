In this project, I learned how data can be used to understand and predict student performance. At the beginning, I explored the dataset and saw how different factors like math, reading, and writing scores, attendance rate, and study hours can influence whether a student passes or fails. I also realized that variables such as parent education, internet access, or extracurricular activities can make a difference in academic results.

Through the data preprocessing stage, I learned the importance of cleaning the dataset — removing unnecessary columns, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data for training and testing. I understood that if the data is not prepared correctly, even good models will not perform well.

When I trained different models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM, I learned how machine learning algorithms work to classify data and make predictions. Even though the accuracy was not very high, it helped me see that model performance depends on many factors such as data quality, feature selection, and parameter tuning.

Finally, I realized that visualization is a powerful way to understand data. The graphs made it clear how scores and attendance differ between students who pass and fail. Overall, this project helped me connect theory with practice — from data exploration to building models — and understand how data science can be applied in education to identify students who might need extra support before failing a class.
